1824,Leather and meat without killing animals,"By 2050, it will take 100 billion land animals to provide the world's population with meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods. Maintaining this herd will take a huge, potentially unsustainable toll on the planet. What if there were a different way?

1825,Why mayors should rule the world,"It often seems like federal-level politicians care more about creating gridlock than solving the world's problems. So who's actually getting bold things done?
