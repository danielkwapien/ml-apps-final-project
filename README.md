# Machine Learning Applications Project

**Grade: 9.5**

During this course, we have learned about:
* Designing a data model for a data analysis task
* Selecting and using effectively data analysis methods
* Cleaning, adapting and processing text data
* Designing and applying **Natural Language Processing** methods
* Designing and applying **Recommender Systems**

## Final project

The final project of this course consisted in using a custom dataset, which in our case was obtained by scraping the TED website, applying the different text preprocessing and 
vectorization methods we have seen in class and apply different text vectorization to solve a problem, in our case it was a classification problem where we wanted to predict
the topic of a TED talk based on its title and description.
